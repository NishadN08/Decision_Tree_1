# Decision_Tree

This is a Machine Learning porject to determine the reusult of a car purchased by user by using the car_data dataset.
We have determined this by using a Decision Tree algorithm, which allows us to find if the user is able to purchase a car.
The features in the dataset are User ID, Gender, Age, Annual Salary, Car purchased.
We have dropped the User ID feature as it is not used.
The Car purchased is our target feature which will help us to predict based on the data available.
